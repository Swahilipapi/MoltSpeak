## 2. Domain

## Summary: What I'm Waiting For

| Item | Status | Blocking |
|------|--------|----------|
| GitHub repo URL | ⏳ | Deploys |
| Domain | ⏳ | All URLs |
| Hosting access | ⏳ | Website |
| npm token | ⏳ | JS package |
| PyPI token | ⏳ | Python package |

Once you provide these, I can execute the full release autonomously.
